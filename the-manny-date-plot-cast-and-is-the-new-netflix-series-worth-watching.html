Cowboys are not known for their child-rearing skills, but this is Netflix, and here we are. The unconventional 'manny' turns out to be not just a boon, but a real romantic eye-opener as well.</p><h2 class=split>'The Manny' cast</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>When will 'Single’s Inferno' Season 4 air? Release date, time and how to watch Netflix's dating show</a></p><h3 class=split3>Sandra Echeverría</h3><p>Echeverría is an actor and a singer known for a slew of top-notch roles on Mexican TV and cinema. She is best known for playing Estefania in 'Soñarás' and most recently Isabel in 'El Grupo'. She also played Magda in Oliver Stone's underrated 'Savages' (or overrated if you're <a href=# rel=noopener>talking about THAT scene</a>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ef367ed2-e3d1-4a5d-8a81-8aa9820db0a9.jpg><h2 class=split>Iván Amozurrutia</h2><p>Amozurrutia broke into the Mexican television firmament as Osvaldo in the series 'Enamorándome de Ramón'. Since then he has starred as Federico Marroquín in&nbsp;</p><p>'The Five Juanas' and others, but he is most noted for his outstanding performance as Poncho Quiroga in the series 'High Heat'. Both he and Echeverría are slated to star in the upcoming as-yet-untitled Carolina Rivera Series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/63ee1f2e-c4b4-40b3-a2c2-4536c0a3a0ab.jpg><h2 class=split>Who created and wrote 'The Manny'?</h2><p>Netflix says it's THE Carolina Rivera, IMDb claims to know nothing, Wikipedia is full of pre-Christmas pudding and the PR agencies are off for the holidays, so what's a guy to do? Well, let's -- for the sake of raising our expectations -- assume that Netflix is right and 'The Manny' has been created by Carolina Rivera then you're in for a treat. Rivera has written for some of the best shows out there. Starting in 1996 when she made her debut as a writer with 'Cilantro y perejil', Rivera has gone on to write for 'Devious Maids', 'Jane the Virgin' and 'Daughter from Another Mother'.</p><h2 class=split>Is 'The Manny' worth watching?</h2><p>In short, yes. Rivera (if Netflix is to be believed, on which the jury is out seeing as the platform also tells us all its shows and movies are great) is extremely capable of delivering the hilarity and the emotion, and with the strong cast, there is absolutely no reason 'The Manny' shouldn't turn out to be great fun for the entire family.</p><p><strong>MEAWW Watch ranking</strong></p><p>3 out of 5</p><h2 class=split>'The Manny' trailer</h2><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'The Brothers Sun is extremely good': Internet 'highly recommends' Netflix's action-packed dramedy show</a></p><p><a href=#>Will there be 'The Brothers Sun' Season 2?
