Although the Queen is obviously the Queen, he's the boss, and Harry is very, very fond of him."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But he still has to follow medical advice.

It is a family occasion and he would be enormously disappointed to miss out," she adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marlene Koenig, founder of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Royal Musings" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Royal Musings</a> blog, agrees: "I want to think that Philip will do everything in his power to attend his grandson's wedding, even if he is in a wheelchair." (Larcombe, however, believes there's "no chance" the Duke will be using a wheelchair at the wedding.)</p><img alt="Uniform, Military uniform, Military officer, Event, Military rank, Fashion accessory, " title="Uniform, Military uniform, Military officer, Event, Military rank, Fashion accessory, " width=3000 height=2233 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-philip-prince-harry-450597706-1525469681.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince Philip and Prince Harry in 2014</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">But he might not stay for the reception.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Harry and Meghan exchange vows at St. George's Chapel, two receptions are planned to follow: one daytime luncheon at St. George's Hall, and an evening celebration at Frogmore House. Prince Philip might take it easy and not attend both afterparties.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My understanding is he'll go to the wedding, maybe go to the first reception, and then he won't go to the second reception," Larcombe says.

However, he won't have a defined function like Meghan's parents or Prince William do.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Neither the Queen nor Prince Philip would have any reason to 'participate' in the wedding, but they would be there in attendance just as any other grandparent would be," Arbiter says.

"The Queen will be the last person to arrive before Meghan comes down the aisle and Philip will be right there with her," Larcombe explains.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Prince Philip and Prince Harry have a close relationship.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Both William and Harry are very close to their grandparents," Arbiter explains. "They always have been, but the bond was really solidified when they lost their mother. The Princes were up at Balmoral when Diana died and both the Queen and Prince Philip rallied around [them] to do everything they could in terms of offering comfort and support."</p><img alt="Suit, Formal wear, Uniform, White-collar worker, Tuxedo, Businessperson, Event, Gesture, Bodyguard, Official, " title="Suit, Formal wear, Uniform, White-collar worker, Tuxedo, Businessperson, Event, Gesture, Bodyguard, Official, " width=2048 height=1464 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-harry-philip-diana-funeral-136110362-1-1525469539.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince Philip joined Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry, and Prince Charles at Princess Diana’s funeral procession in 1997.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It also helps that Philip and his grandson have similar personalities.
