That’s right: the live-action Ahsoka Tano herself, Rosario Dawson, is hyping fans up for a second season of the Disney Plus series.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>In a conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Empire Magazine</a>, Dawson spoke about the possibility of a second season, and she seemed pretty optimistic about its odds:</p><p>“I’m absolutely putting it out into the universe… We’re joking about it, but I’m manifesting it because I feel like I helped Dave [Filoni, Star Wars mastermind and Ahsoka Tano’s co-creator] manifest this role. So I’m ready. I’m excited. I’m willing. I got my ice-packs ready to go for Season 2 and beyond! I would not be mad at that.”</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Dawson also revealed that what drew her to the character of Ahsoka was her complexity and backstory. The character <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">originated in 2008’s Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a>, an animated spin-off which explored the prequel era in greater depth. Now considered to be a fan-favorite, Ahsoka was originally thought to be an annoyance by many fans, who compared her to other, notoriously unpopular characters.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>The Clone Wars continued to explore Ahsoka’s character despite the backlash, however, and the fact that the series was co-created by both Filoni and George Lucas, who had a direct hand in the character’s creation, helped matters. Many fans now consider her to be on par with – or to even have surpassed, in some respects – the other characters created by Lucas, such as Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Padme Amidala.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>The character was originally portrayed by voice actress Ashley Eckstein. Following her live-action debut on The Mandalorian back in 2020, Dawson has portrayed the character in every live-action appearance. Eckstein has, however, returned to the role for her animated appearances. Last October, an anthology series titled Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi was released; Eckstein returned to lend her voice to the project, which focused heavily on broadening Ahsoka’s story even further.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=false>The presence of such a rich backstory seems to have helped Dawson develop the character; she speaks of Ahsoka having had “some really tough crises and traumas in her life”, likely referring to her experiences throughout the Clone Wars. The character also has extensive on-screen history with other characters who will be appearing in Ahsoka – references and nods to Filoni’s other contribution to the Star Wars canon, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Rebels</a>, will be feature heavily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu82tZLCnoqfGbr%2FTmqlmr5GnwG6ywKeqZqqfqK6ztc5mm5qvo6S7brXSZpilqpWWsbp5zJqlop6VqMGqusZmmKGrn6Cubr%2FEmqqopl1nfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
