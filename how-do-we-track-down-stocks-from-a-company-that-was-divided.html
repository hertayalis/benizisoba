Please help us find them. D.J.</strong></p><p>Dear D.J.: The transfer agent for the breakup of AT&T, of which Western Electric was a part, is Computershare at (800) 351-7221. It can be reached between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern time Monday through Friday. Or anytime at Computershare.com/att.</p><p>If anyone knows what happened to your mother’s stock, these would be the people. There is a chance the accounts were turned over to the state in which your mother lives as abandoned property.</p><p>Each state has a list of “abandoned property,” and you might get lucky if that’s the case. But you also might have to hire someone who knows what he is doing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGtmbGhfnby4ecOoZLCdXam%2Foq%2FKZpuor55iwLW7wqSqZp6ipLpurYycpqaokaPGbsDHmqtmr5GoeqW11aKbnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
