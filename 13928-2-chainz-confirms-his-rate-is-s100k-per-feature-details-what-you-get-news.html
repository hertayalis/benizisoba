Tity Boi also spoke about his crazy amount of features, and how he has some he's never even heard yet, and he has to be careful not to re-use lines.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for his rate, the Hair Weave Killa said, "Let me start, man, 'cause I know there's people out here listening: Look, I'm enjoying life, okay? You would be doing the same thing. Don't look down upon me." The rapper continued, &nbsp;"[You might ask,] 'Who's gonna pay that for a verse?' Your favorite rapper paid it. Don't even worry about it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">2 Chainz continued to explain the perks of paying $100k. "The thing is, when it comes to your video, I'm gonna change clothes twice. They're never gonna see that outfit again," he said, before mentioning Givenchy and Alexander McQueen as potential clothing items. "I'm gonna give you bars. I'm gonna wear fancy glasses and a bunch of chains you've never seen. I mean, I can&nbsp;help&nbsp;you."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rapper continued, "You get me. You get charisma. You get girls that's gonna come to your video shoot 'cause they know I'ma be there. So this [is] your chance to get in!" And if you're thinking you can negotiate with Chainz, he's not into bargaining.&nbsp;"I'm not doin' deals. I'm tellin' what I give you, for that number. These are the services that I offer."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Watch his interview with BBC1 below (via <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">HHDX</a>).</p><p><br><h2>22</h2></p><p>2 Chainz Confirms His Rate Is $100K Per Feature, Details What You Get</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Editor-in-Chief&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Rose Lilah updates HNHH daily, while also managing the other writers on-staff and all HNHH contributors.
