In his rookie season, Wiggins averaged 16.9 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Wiggins</a> continued to improve in his subsequent seasons with the Timberwolves, and in 2017, he signed a five-year, $148 million contract extension with the team. However, despite his strong individual performances, the Timberwolves struggled to make the playoffs, and Wiggins was eventually traded to the Golden State Warriors in 2020.</p><p>Since joining the Warriors, Wiggins has continued to be a key contributor to the team’s success. He has shown versatility on both ends of the court, with his ability to score from a variety of positions and defend multiple positions. His strong performances have helped the Warriors remain competitive in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p><p>Off the court, Wiggins is known for his philanthropic work and dedication to social justice issues.
