Then his leg swelled and flushed. His next stop was the hospital, where doctors found an aggressive bacterial infection called necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection that eats healthy cells, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to KETV in Omaha.</a></p><p>The horrifying condition threatened to take the young man’s leg, the station said. So doctors decided to strip away the infected tissue, then treat the wound in a Nebraska hospital’s hyperbaric oxygen chamber.</p><p>The fifth-year senior endured multiple surgeries during his 13-day hospital stay.</p><p>“By doing surgery, getting this opened up and kind of cleaned out as well as then presenting more oxygen into both the tissue from that wound … as well as just in the bloodstream, [it] basically helps kind of suppress and help kill the bacteria in addition to antibiotics,” Roy Maurer, a physician associate, told the station.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Wrestler Peyton Robb fell ill with a flesh-eating bacteria that threatened to rob him of his left leg. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Doctors decided to strip away the infected skin, then treat him in a hyperbaric chamber. <span class=credit>KETV</span></figure><p>Robb spent more than two hours a day, five days a week for six weeks in the tank, which doctors flooded with pure oxygen in the hopes that it would help cells recover faster and more efficiently.</p><p>“There was a lot of moments where I was just kind of in pain,” Robb told the network. “Sometimes it was just subtle, sometimes a little bit more.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The hyperbaric chamber was pumped full of pure oxygen, which doctors say helped cells recover more quickly. <span class=credit>KETV</span></figure><p>Despite the high-stakes crucible, Robb has kept a positive attitude.
