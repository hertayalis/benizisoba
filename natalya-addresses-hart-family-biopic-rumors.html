A prime reason dates back to her rich roots and lineage, coming from the highly acclaimed Hart wrestling family.</p><p>The family has been around for decades in the wrestling business and is regarded as one of the most prominent dynasties in Canada. Some of the most iconic figures from the Hart Family include Stu Hart, Jim ‘The Anvil’ Neidhart, British Bull Dog, Owen Hart, and perhaps their biggest star, Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart.</p><p>Reports surfaced that stated <a href=#>Natalya was in discussions with production house for a potential biopic about his iconic family</a>. Moreover, it also mentioned that ideas for casting had also been floated.</p><p><a href=#>During an interview with Natalya at the Royal Rumble weekend</a>, she addressed the reports claiming that she had no clear picture regarding the movie. However, Nattie did mention that it was something in the works and it held a special place in her heart.</p><p>“I can’t confirm and I can’t deny, but there is something I’ve been working on that is really close to my heart. I’ve been working on it for a little while now and I feel like we’re in such a boom right now with the industry and with wrestling.</p><p>” My family, there are so many incredible stories that have never been told that are so great. For me, to be able to celebrate my family and celebrate everything we’ve built, there are so many positive things.“</p><p>Yes, I’m working on something close to my heart. Rory Caulkin is a huge wrestling fan. Rory and his brothers were sitting front row for SummerSlam when I won the Women’s Championship at the Barclays Center. I love when we meet people for other walks of life that love this industry.”</p><p>With so much history, moments, and enthralling matches related to the Hart family legacy, it would be interesting to see a biopic made on one of the most renowned wrestling families in the world.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Do you think The Hart Family biopic should be made?
