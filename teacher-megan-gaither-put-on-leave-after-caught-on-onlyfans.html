It’s really hard to stretch those paychecks during the summer. That’s why I did it,” she told the news outlet.</p><p>Gaither said she joined the subscription-based site in May to help pay back more than $125,000 in student loans. Her total pay last year,&nbsp;including a coaching stipend, was about $47,500, the paper reported.</p><p>Her colleague Brianna Coppage, a former freshman and sophomore English teacher at the school, recently resigned to devote all her time to porn after she was placed on leave when it was revealed she was running an OnlyFans page with her husband.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Megan Gaither, 31, is the second teacher at St. Clair High School in Missouri to have landed in hot water for selling porn on OnlyFans to supplement their income. <span class=credit>Megan Gaither/Facebook</span></figure><p>Coppage was suspended on Sept. 27 after district officials got wind of her scandalous side gig, which she took on to supplement her measly salary of $42,000.</p><p>The former teacher told Fox News that she’s made close to $1 million selling porn after ditching her teaching duties and making global headlines.</p><p>Gaither told the Post-Dispatch that she had deactivated her OnlyFans account, which had about 1,500 subscribers, after Coppage’s account was discovered by school officials.</p><p>She said she was making an additional $3,000 to $5,000 a month on OnlyFans at the time, but that she kept her face hidden in an effort to remain anonymous.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Brianna Coppage said she was motivated to launch her porn account to bolster her measly educator’s salary. <span class=credit>Brianna Coppage/X</span></figure><p>But rumors began to circulate among students when she appeared in a video on Coppage’s account. Although her face was not seen in the video, which was shot at a party in a St. Louis hotel room, when a photo from the event appeared online, she was wearing the same outfit she had on in the video, according to the paper.</p><p>“I was in like maybe four minutes of the entire thing, and I definitely did not think this would be the thing that would ruin my entire career,” Gaither told the Post-Dispatch.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Coppage has reportedly raked in close to $1 million selling porn after her story made international headlines. <span class=credit>Brianna Coppage/Instagram</span></figure><p>She said a student slipped a note under her classroom door suggesting they “knew her secret.”</p><p>Gaither and Coppage told the paper they didn’t know they were both on OnlyFans until June, when Gaither made an offhand remark at a “Teachers Night” at Busch Stadium.</p><p>On Friday, Gaither described Coppage as her best friend.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Brianna Coppage was suspended on September 27. <span class=credit>St. Clair School District</span></figure><p>She said the district put her on leave because of “professionalism and student communication,” though she insists she has never acted unprofessionally and had earned good reviews from school officials.</p><p>Gaither, who has master’s degrees from Missouri Baptist University and Arizona State University, said she still loves teaching but that her “career at St. Clair is over regardless of what I do.”</p><p>“I legitimately have love in my heart for each and every one of (my students),” she told the Post-Dispatch. “The students are why I told myself I would spend 30 years of my life at that school, and I feel like I am abandoning them. I know I will likely never see them again.”</p><p>School Superintendent Kyle Kruse told the outlet that the “district does not have a statement to issue at this time.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gaither says she was put on leave Friday after her X-rated moonlighting job was revealed. <span class=credit>Google Maps</span></figure><p>Gaither said she and her husband have already talked about moving and that she would likely reactivate her OnlyFans account.</p><p>“Right now, I am just hoping to make enough to support my family,” she told the paper, adding that she suspects other teachers have turned to the adult site to bolster their income.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if there are other teachers out there (in Missouri),” Gaither said. “Teachers are probably freaking out right now because two teachers from the same school, in less than a month, have been caught.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmbGhfo7K4v46tnJqbmJq%2FbrnEoJinZZeWtrW0xKtkqa2kYryvecuemK%2BdXZaztbHRZpqarZedwW67zWamp6Spm66vv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
