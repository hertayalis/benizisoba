Since then, the iconic actress has made viewers fall in love with her undeniable talent and effortless beauty.</p><p>Over the years, Renée has completely transformed into whatever her roles required her to be. Whether she changed her hairstyle and rocked a totally different color or completely chopped off her long locks, the <a href=#>Bridget Jones’ Diary</a> star has served some incredible looks for more than the last two decades.</p><p>With that said, Renee’s altering style didn’t always receive the most positive reaction. The Golden Globe winner has been open and honest about the criticism she’s endured from rude fans regarding her appearance, revealing <a href=#>bullying and depression were the reasons she retreated from Hollywood</a> and acting in 2010.</p><p>During a vulnerable interview for the September 2019 issue of <a href=#>Vulture</a>, Renée got candid about how sad it makes her when people <a href=#>speculate she underwent plastic surgery</a>. “It probably gives you a stomachache asking me about that, doesn’t it?” she asked after the reporter told her he was a little reluctant to bring up the “whole plastic surgery kerfuffle.”</p><p>“Well, because there’s a value judgment that’s placed on us,” the Chicago actress said in response. “As if it somehow is a reflection of your character — whether you’re a good person or a weak person or an authentic person.”</p><p>Renée’s looks first came under scrutiny when she hit the red carpet at the ELLE Women in Hollywood Awards in 2014 looking nearly unrecognizable. The Oscar-winning star, who stepped out of the spotlight for nearly six years following the event, expressed how much it truly hurt her.</p><p>“The implication that I somehow needed to change what was going on because it wasn’t working,” the Cold Mountain actress said. “That makes me sad. I don’t look at beauty in that way. And I don’t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. It enables me to do what I do.”</p><p>Fortunately, Renée reemerged in 2016 with Bridget Jones 3, proving she belongs in Hollywood more now than ever. Since then, she’s starred in Same Kind of Different as Me in 2017, Here and Now in 2018 and most recently, <a href=#>Judy</a> in 2019.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see how the iconic actress has transformed through the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rnKedlWLHprjLsJygnaJiwbOtzaydqKqdlsGqu81mqp6dXam1pnnAnKurnaOoerW00aisoKBdqbWmediemKurXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
