Collecting inspiration and imagery for the album, Jones says it was "a blessing to be in lockdown in such a beautiful country."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/DYE7V4qgpBvE6dmI60ZPlZzq_Gg=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/HMIEYAJRQUMH3TNYNUFRSHPS2E.jpg"><p>The resulting music video for single <i>No Daylight</i> features vistas from Auckland, south through Raglan and Waikato, to the shores of Lake Wakatipu.

What could be better?"</p><p>The new 13, track album was compiled as a love letter to New Zealand, written over long roadies and day trips from Auckland.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"America has stunning natural beauty, but there is very little left that is truly untouched," she says.</p><p>"New Zealand is one of the rare places on Earth where that kind of unpopulated wild beauty still exists and is accessible to people of all walks of life."</p><p>While based out of Auckland the singer was able to collaborate with Kiwi artists out of the city's Roundhead Studios. This included a recording with Hamilton-based The Trenwiths, over the cliffs at Raglan.</p><p>However Jones says she has a long list of all-time favourite New Zealand bands, she'd love to go on the road with:</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-travel">Related articles</h2><p>"Mild Orange; I love their sonic sensibilities. Of course, Neil Finn! We also went to a Th'Dudes concert and really fell in love with their new album."</p><p>The wide open skies and countryside of the Land of the Long White Cloud has some obvious similarities to the US and folk music scene. However it's the people and the stories of New Zealand rather than the landscape which Jones feels have the most county roots:</p><p>"I find many parallels between New Zealand culture and country music culture. American country music is rooted in the authentic life experience of working class people," she said.</p><p>"They are the salt of the earth, much like I find Kiwis to be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte8Cnq6Kon5mytHnCmqmopJmjsm62zqecrGWgp7a3rdOeZKWnppp6orLFmqCrZaeewal5zZ6uZrKVlrmiusNmoKdlnKSwrLDOsKVoh31qkJqip41ue257do6NgLZrj4VvgH6nipmO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
