Apparently, she has no idea what she was thinking during the photoshoot in question. While she does take “full responsibility” for the pose, she now regrets it and realizes that it could no longer be taken back.</p><p>“Okay, can anybody tell me what I was thinking when I decided to pose like this on an international, worldwide poster that will remain forevermore? I remember doing this pose and thinking, ‘I think I look pretty cool here.’ (laughs) So I take full responsibility for this choice, but oh my God, what am I leaning against? What is my elbow doing?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@karengillan100 href=#>@karengillan100</a><p>The Nebula pose 😂<a title=guardiansofthegalaxy href=#>#guardiansofthegalaxy</a> <a title=nebula href=#>#nebula</a> <a title=marvel href=#>#marvel</a> <a title=marvelstudios href=#>#marvelstudios</a></p><a title="♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey" href=#>♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys – Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey</a></figure><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>According to Gillan, she originally thought that doing the pose would look cool and that in her mind at the time, she was “trying to get her weapon,” only to realize that she isn’t armed. The actress considered “doubling down” on the aforementioned pose during press tours and the red-carpet premiere, just to see if she can make it a thing. She ended her video by saying that the awkward pose will return on an undisclosed date.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Despite what Gillan thinks, almost everyone in that poster looks awkward if you think about it. We have Star Lord wearing casual clothing. Meanwhile, everyone else is looking somewhere on the horizon. They’re a pretty awkward bunch, but Gillan is the only cast member who’s open about it.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=false>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is said to be the final film for this superhero lineup, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Bautista leaving the role of Drax</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation that this may be the end of the line for our heroes</a>. The film’s director, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Gunn, hinted at “emotional devastation”</a> after it was revealed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocket Raccoon’s past will be the movie’s main focus</a>. The film is scheduled to come out on May 5, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoopqqlaN6qLXLpZinZaSWuKa%2FjJ%2BspaRdp7K0vM6nqqKamaG2tcWMn6arZZGsuLit0Z1koK2Rp7Gqrc2sZKieXam1pnnGmqOasKlivbC%2F056pZqifqLJutc1mpZ6vXam2rMDOpGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
