Allegedly, <strong>Louie Ruelas</strong> hired him as a private investigator to dig up information on the other cast members because his family was receiving death threats. However, the cast thinks Bo was hired to do more than that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Now, he’s giving his stance on the dramatic accusations.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>If you don’t recall, <a href=#><strong>Luis “Louie” Ruelas</strong></a> hired private investigator <strong>Bo Dietl</strong> to dig on the other cast mates, after he and <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> allegedly received death threats.</p><p>However, not everyone was convinced that’s the only thing he’s trying to dig into.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Joe Gorga</strong></a> implied that Bo was investigating more than just the death threats, and was actually trying to uncover dirt about Luis’s cast mates. Bo shut the rumors down.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“All of us a sudden this little punk Joe Gorga comes out and he has something to say to me that I lied about I did investigations on the cast members. Again, I’m telling you right now Joe … I told you and your wife, ‘I did not do that,’” Bo shared in an audio clip shared by <a href=#>@allabouttrh</a> on Twitter.</p><p>“As far as me doing any other personal investigations for Lou other than the cast members, that’s none of your business, you little punk,” Bo went on.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“I tell you what, if you call me a liar and you want to have a problem with me, I don’t think you want me after you.</p><p>“Because [I’ll] tell you right now Joe, I’ll do the investigation on you for free by me. I don’t need Lou to pay for it. You better know who you’re talking to. I’m not one of those little punks that you’re running around. You might go in the gym there, watch your little muscles, but muscles doesn’t give somebody balls,” he added.</p><p>“You wanna play with me?” Bo said. “Why don’t you ask some of your friends about me? I’m the wrong guy you mess with.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmm6ddmbamwMtmpqmdnqh6tryMmpmoraRiv6m7zaNkqaqZq661sYyipa%2Bdo6m2qK3ToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
