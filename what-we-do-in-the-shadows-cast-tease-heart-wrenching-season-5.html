"It's really heart-breaking, and it was really hard to shoot," he continued: "And I remember afterwards I was like, 'Oh, I hope the audience feels what he's going through.' So, you'll have to wait and see!"</p><p id=ePxk4IPq9l data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>7 best shows and movies coming to Netflix in June</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eI0Fekey_Yqh data-wc=43>Speaking earlier during the panel, Harvey also revealed: "This upcoming season, we [will] see Guillermo's family come back… They'll be back this season, and we do get more of a glimpse into his past, and potentially where he stands, and then his future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/33adafff7986-harry-potter-hbo-news-mcm-comic-con-4.jpg><p id=etlUqg0JkYbO data-wc=36>"This season is gonna be kind of an emotional roller coaster," he finished reflectively, as Kayvan – who joined Harvey for fan questions during his spotlight interview on the convention's main stage – nodded to agree.</p><p id=eTj0Ui3c1CVY data-wc=73>Season four of <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>the FX show</a></strong> (which is shown in the UK via the BBC and BBC iPlayer) saw Guillermo go through many emotional journeys which included coming out to his family, and ended with him choosing to leave his vampiric master Nandor in the hopes that he could pay another vampire to turn him into one. Therefore, it's unsurprising that the cast have revealed season five will also feature many emotional beats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3b9e28c5550c-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-cast-tease-season-5-2.jpg><p id=eUOqoiVdEhth data-wc=84>Despite being beloved for its hilarious moments, the sweeter and deeper scenes between the comedy show's characters are just as treasured by fans who've grown attached to the new storylines invented for the TV adaptation of Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's mockumentary film. And WWDITS devotees can rest assured there will be a lot more of these aspects to come in the future, as the show was renewed for both a fifth and sixth season back before the airing of season four last year.</p><p id=eKsoidC_c2iO data-wc=60>During this Saturday's interview, Harvey also discussed some emotional moments in his own life. Following on from his landmark <strong></strong> article where he opened up about dealing with homophobia as a child, the actor described how he had recently used fashion to reclaim the 'Mariposa' (translated literally meaning butterfly) slur which had been thrown his way when he was young.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4044a82fa9c8-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-cast-tease-season-5-1.jpg><p id=er1FsM0sY7o4 data-wc=60>"I hosted the GLAAD awards in America, and I worked with Christian Siriano on an outfit that was covered in butterflies," he said proudly. Later, he also discussed his Met Gala look which was also designed by Christian, explaining: "We made history when he designed for me because it's the first time he's ever designed for a plus sized guy…</p><p id=eupTlZEJIDzP data-wc=38>"Hopefully this opens the door up for more fashion designers in the future to see that there's tons of different body types out there, not just one type, and we should cater to all of them," he finished.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/460dce687a31-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-cast-tease-season-5.jpg><p id=eZNAbdrQLS3y data-wc=36>Harvey will soon be starring as the DC comic book character Dr. Sanchez in the movie this August, meanwhile season five is set to begin airing in July.</p><p id=e30Bh3wpt8wT data-wc=26></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
