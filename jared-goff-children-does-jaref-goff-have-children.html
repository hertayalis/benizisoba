Jared Goff has a sister called Lauren Goff. She attended the University of California at Berkeley. Goff was an avid participant in baseball, football, and soccer starting at a young age. But it wasn’t until he entered Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield, California, that he started concentrating solely on the American pastime.</p><p>Jared Goff played three seasons of varsity football for his high school, completing 477 of 767 passes for a 62.2% completion rate and 7,687 yards.
