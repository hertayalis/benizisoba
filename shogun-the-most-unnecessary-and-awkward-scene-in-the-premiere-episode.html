Based on the 1975 James Clavell novel of the same name, Shōgun is a masterpiece of political intrigue, with a heightened hypersensitivity reflecting the life-or-death stakes of Japanese warrior ethos. One such tradition is seppuku, best described as ritual suicide performed to save one’s dignity. If only one unnecessary scene in the premiere episode could’ve shown a little dignity, seppuku-style, and taken itself out.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>But first, some plot context. We encounter feudal Japan through Englishman John Blackthorne, and Cosmo Jarvis’ performance will likely remind some of Tom Hardy’s as Max in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Max: Fury Road</a>; both are portrayals of outsiders who might otherwise suffer culture shock in a new land, if it wasn’t for the constant perils of being held prisoner by a mighty warlord.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Enter Lord Yabushige, who arrives in a coastal village that his nephew directly oversees — and Yabushige, in turn, oversees his nephew — in order to sort out this foreign ship that has drifted off course. Among several shipboard survivors is, you guessed it, Blackthorne, one of whose crewmates is ordered a most gruesome death by Yabushige, whose only motive, seemingly, is a desire to hear the condemned’s screams from a distance.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The cold-hearted Yabushige is played unusually well by Tadanobu Asano, whose constant jovial smiling would have you falsely assume his heart is warm. If not for his character’s ruthlessness, Asano’s cheerful face would come across almost like a version of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Claus</a>. However unlikely this may sound, the contrast works really well.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>As the story unfolds, Shōgun gifts us numerous memorable scenes from an applause-worthy script. However, we also bear witness to a sex scene so completely unnecessary that we wondered why it was included — though the obvious answer would be that sex and nudity will get more people to watch, unfortunately.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>But Shōgun’s story needs no such scenes to grab attention, and this oddly misplaced one only serves to disappoint, somewhat.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>After Yabushige orders the foreign sailor’s death, surprised that the Englishman died “inarticulate,” he retreats to his temporary quarters, where a man offers him a woman (Yuka Kouri) as a gift for the night. Yabushige asks the man to leave, but instead the woman touches the man seductively, and lays him down. Yabushige asks what she’s doing, to which she simply replies that if he wants her to stop, then she will. Yabushige does not ask her to stop, though. The woman then uses the man’s hands to undress her, and suddenly, we are invited into what looks like a threesome.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>The ensuing nudity, as well as the whole scene, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">feels completely unnecessary</a> to the episode’s storytelling, especially considering that otherwise, numerous subtleties are masterfully at work. Of course, none of those subtleties throughout the episode are sexual, either. So, maybe the writers weren’t sure how to handle this scene, and seeing as how they didn’t take it even further, likely thought they were being subtle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=724 data-current-count=1024 data-injectable=true>The ends rather awkwardly, with Yabushige suddenly turning his attention to the lovemaking duo, after seemingly not initially knowing what they were trying to do. Upon realizing, his expression goes from confusion to his usual, Santa Claus-like smile. You almost expect laughter followed by a “ho, ho, ho” which would hardly be appropriate for a threesome. To further the awkwardness, Yabushige’s “happy place” face is the last shot of the scene. Even more bizarre, we hear no more about the man and woman in the episode, nor in the next one. Kouri is listed as appearing in five episodes, though, so clearly she plays a part in the narrative. Still, this scene could’ve been done so differently, and so simply.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Even so, I’m sure many will disagree, and enjoy the scene. But it’s disappointing that such a script-heavy series in service of an outstanding story decides to throw in a nude scene — and another one right after, of Blackborne’s backside — just to get more people to watch.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=false>Regardless, the jovial smile on Yabushige’s face makes the scene somewhat comical. Thankfully, it’s not enough to ruin the outstanding premiere episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0tM6grKdlpJ2ybrnOrKtmrZ6jsqSx0qyYq7FdlrulecCworCZopl6tK%2FEp5xmoZ5iwamxjKmpnqWZmr%2BmecSpoKynlJp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
