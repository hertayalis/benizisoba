After all, the dates that take place abroad are always the most extravagant…</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>To find out for yourself — based on information spoiled by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality Steve</a>, as well as information spoiled in the trailer — just keep scrolling.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>One-on-one date: Lexi Young</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Bachelorette_-Lexi.png><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Given that their connection has been growing stronger and stronger each and every week — even earning her the title of “Mrs. Right” during the group date in episode 3 — a one-on-one date between Joey Graziadei and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lexi Young</a> was long overdue, finally taking place in episode 4.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>According to Reality Steve, Joey and Lexi “did the local date in Malta where they went shopping and hung with locals,” and based on the trailer for this week’s double feature, it looks like they shared quite a few smooches as well. The date seemed to be smooth sailing, but we will not know for sure until it hits our television screens tonight…</p><h2 id=h-two-on-one-date-maria-georgas-and-sydney-gordon data-injectable=false>Two-on-one date: Maria Georgas and Sydney Gordon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maria-and-Sydney-The-Bachelor.png><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Arguably the most intriguing date of episode 4 will be the two-on-one date between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sydney Gordon</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Georgas</a> that The Bachelor himself deemed to be “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">awkward as ever</a>,” finally squashing the beef has been consuming our television screens 24/7.</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>For those who are unfamiliar with the feud between Sydney and Maria, it began when 31-year-old Madina felt as though her connection with Joey was not as far along as some of the other contestants due to their three-year age gap. Maria was caught invalidating her feelings — talking smack about Madina to the other women within the Bachelor Mansion — which is when Sydney decided to intervene, throwing around words like “bullying” and “attacking” to Joey, as well as the rest of his hopefuls.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>As the drama between Sydney and Maria continues to escalate, the pair seemingly takes a boat to their two-on-one date, but we will just have to wait and see who ultimately gets the boot by The Bachelor himself.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Group date: The 12 remaining women</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Bachelor-7.png><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>The group date in episode 4 is arguably the kookiest one yet, with the 12 remaining women all taking part: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Anderson</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Autumn Waggoner</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jess Edwards</a>, Madina Alam, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy Kent</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Nance</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lea Cayanan</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Allison Hollinger</a>, Katelyn DeBacker, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Toussant</a>, Jenn Tran, and Edwina Dorbor.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>According to Reality Steve, “They went to a fort and met knights and had sword fights. After sword fighting, there was a competition to see who got extra time with Joey and they had to catch sausages in their mouths. Autumn won and got extra time.”</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>While there are 15 women fighting for the heart of the handsome Joey Graziadei in episode 4, who will be catching a one-way flight back to the United States after the rose ceremony? To see how the remainder of season 28 unfolds, tune into ABC on Mondays for brand new episodes of The Bachelor, or stream them the following day via Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2ZpJrAbsPIpaNmp5OYwrN5w66poqaXYrKxtdKom55lZGK8p3nToZxmmpGYtaa4zqtkraCVYryvsYyopWannpp6tcPOZqanZZ%2Bjsm6tzZ1koKqfqr1usMCtnGaqlauyorjEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
