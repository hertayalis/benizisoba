This has resulted in veganism or the number of people following vegan diets increasing day by day. Legendary boxer<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> Mike Tyson</a>, however, holds a different opinion about the vegan diet. The <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>vegan news website plantbasednews.org</a> reported that Tyson stopped consuming vegan diets and why that was the case. Very few people know that Tyson was a vegan for a long time, and also, on various occasions, he promoted vegan culture. Recently, he began eating a normal diet again. Along with him, other celebrities have changed their vegan lifestyle, including ‘Wednesday’ actress Jenna Ortega, and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Miley Cirus</a>. But the question here is why they are opting out of vegan diets. Before this, let’s understand what veganism is and why people follow it.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What is the vegan diet, and why did Mike Tyson follow it previously?</h2><p>In reality, three main types of diet are followed around the world. Non-vegetarian, vegetarian, and vegan. While vegans and vegetarians both have almost similar characteristics, vegans differ from vegetarians in that they are solely plant-based eaters, while vegetarians consume milk and eggs in some parts of the world. Vegans avoid milk too, which makes them exceptional. People follow vegan diets primarily to avoid processed foods, avoid the toxins that come with animal-based foods and save the environment.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-boxing-legend-mike-tyson-reveals-why-he-always-wore-black?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1241362676-424x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Boxing Legend Mike Tyson Reveals Why He Always Wore Black</p></a><p>The vegan diet Tyson chose made him exceptional, even though boxing requires fitness and a high-protein diet. In 2013, on Oprah Winfrey’s show Tyson promoting veganism said, “I just felt like changing my life, doing something different. And so I became a vegan. Becoming a vegan, it gave me another opportunity to live a healthy life … High blood pressure, almost dying, arthritis and once I became a vegan all that stuff diminished.” But why did Tyson start eating a normal diet again?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1241362676-424x315.jpg><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Why did Mike Tyson quit the vegan diet?</h2><p>On popular YouTuber <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Joe Rogan’s</a> podcast, Tyson claimed that he quit the vegan diet in 2020. Tyson said, “I stopped because of the training and because of what I wanted my body to look like and the strength that I wanted to possess,”. The boxer cited a problem with strength.</p><p>In addition to him, actress Jenna Ortega also struggled with a vegan diet, which eventually led her to quit. In Romania, where she was filming her next Netflix series, Wednesday, vegan food was scarce, which is a big reason she gave up the practice.</p><p>Miley Cyrus also blamed the vegan diet for causing brain fog and confusion in thinking. She was one of the major celebrity faces of the vegan movement. Cyrus recently introduced fish to her diet. She said, “I’ve had to introduce fish and omegas into my life because my brain wasn’t functioning properly.”</p><p>Watch this story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Mike Tyson confronts Naomi Osaka’s boyfriend with brutal reality check</strong></a></p><p>Plant-based diets can be beneficial for people in many ways, but there are some drawbacks, usually, the lack of protein or nutrients that are found in animal-based foods are unavailable in vegan diets, for example, 100g of red meat contains 32 grams of protein, while vegan meat or tofu of same amount contains only 17 grams protein. Yet, technology is helping these vegan foods to have more nutrients and to increase protein count. Still, they need to go a long way. Is vegan food good or a bad idea?
