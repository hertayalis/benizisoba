I didn't really know what to do," she shared.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Wife of 'Hot Felon' Jeremy Meeks On Him Dating Heiress: 'I Was in Shock'</a><p id=e_tyTsH7pWv data-wc=102>When asked what she thought of her husband's sudden rise to fame, Melissa admitted she was happy for him but also had some concerns. She revealed: "I was happy for him. Did I want him to succeed? Absolutely." But continued to say: "You've heard stories. You've seen stuff happen." Melissa went on to share her anguish, confessing: "It wasn't an easy pill to swallow. This is not anything I expected ... I felt hurt. I felt betrayed. I believed in him, I believed in us.
