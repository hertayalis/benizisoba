US Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) sent the company’s US CEO Brandon Whitworth a letter that calls for a probe of Bud Light’s controversial partnership with Mulvaney, citing the trans influencer’s under-21 audience.</p><p>In the letter sent Wednesday, Cruz and Blackburn claimed that Mulvaney commands an “audience [that] skews significantly younger than the legal drinking age.”</p><p>It pointed to Mulvaney’s “Days of Girlhood” series on Instagram and TikTok, where Mulvaney boasts 1.8 and 10.8 million followers, respectively.</p><p>It was on Mulvaney’s 365th day of girlhood — April 1 — that Bud Light sent her a can with her face on it to celebrate.</p><p>The image of the custom can sparked immediate outrage from conservatives that resulted in boycotts of Bud Light.</p><p>The beer giant has tried to <a href=#>disavow its ties to Mulvaney</a>, blaming the promotion on a since-fired third-party marketing firm.</p><p>It has also placed two marketing executives on leave.</p><p>“We need to clarify the facts that this was one can, one influencer, one post and not a campaign,” Michel Doukeris, CEO of Anheuser-Busch’s parent company AB InBev, said during an earnings call last month.</p><p>Doukeris went on to decry the “misinformation” spread on social media after Mulvaney posted the photo of the custom can.</p><p>Nationwide retail sales of Bud Light sales dropped 23.6% versus a year ago during the week ended May 6 — slightly worse than the 23.3% decline for the week ended April 29, according to data from Bump Williams Consulting and NielsenIQ data.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The controversy began on April 1, when Mulvaney shared a custom can Bud Light sent her to celebrate “365 Days of Girlhood.” <span class=credit>Dylan Mulvaney/Instagram</span></figure><p>Sales of other Anheuser-Busch brands also have been hurt.</p><p>Budweiser was down 9.7% versus an 11.4% drop a week earlier; Michelob Ultra dipped 2.9% versus 4.3%; and Natural Light was down 2.5% versus 5.2% the previous week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25manFflrupsdSsnKtlkqrApLSMpaasnaNiuaiu06pkq5mknruoec6vnKtlkqqxbrjIoJ%2BtZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6upZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
