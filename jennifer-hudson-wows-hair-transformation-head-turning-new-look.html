Are you dating anyone?"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1eed1348e3fe-jennifer-hudson-boyfriend-common.jpg><p id=e-C5Pf7r4X data-wc=80>He revealed he was in fact dating "one of the most beautiful people I've ever met, in life," and coyly revealed it was Jennifer when he said: "She's smart. She loves God. She has something real down-to-earth about her. She's talented. But I set my standard kind of high because she had to have an EGOT," adding: "She had to win an Oscar [for] her first movie. I set my standard high. She had to get her own talk show."&nbsp;</p><p id=eaEj-QHDZ- data-wc=28>That same month, Common was asked about his relationship with the singer during his appearance on The Today Show's Fourth Hour, with Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4e61ba8368a-gettyimages-1858566186.jpg><p id=evnVBfrx1b data-wc=50>He was asked whether he thought the singer could be "the one" and whether or not marriage was on the cards.

I felt like, man, why not just be loving and honest with who I am and who we are? And it felt good."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFw3_9a2Z1 data-wc=21>Most recently, Common was out to support Jennifer as she took part and performed during the NBA All-Star game last weekend.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEsW9O3UV0 data-wc=44>She was part of the celebrity team competing in the event last Friday, and performed at the halftime show on the Sunday.
