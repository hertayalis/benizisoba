He says there was no fire and it actually burned itself out.</p><p>Fisher warned that there's "significant structural damage" to the house. He's asking all neighbors to stay away and caution tape will continue to be placed around the home. Fisher says there is a possibility the first floor could collapse and it is now unlivable.</p><p>Three people were in the house at the time of the explosion. One man was taken to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries and the other two were released at the scene.</p><p>Fisher says a neighbor ran part way into the home to make sure everyone was okay. We're told he was getting checked out by the ambulance on scene.</p><p>Neighbors were watching as firefighters worked around the house, which had blown out windows and glass everywhere. Neighbors 6 News talked with say they felt and heard the explosion in their houses.</p><p>A State police fire marshal will be out to investigate an exact cause, but Fisher believes the homeowner was lighting a wood-burning stove at the time.</p><p>Another neighbor says several pets lived inside the home. He says a dog and two cats have been accounted for, but two others are missing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfpLumecyapWahnp%2FCs7HDZqCnZaCnvLGtzZ5knrCgoby0tc6nZJqsXZiyr8DRnmShmZyheqm7zJ4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
