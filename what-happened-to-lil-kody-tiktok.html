Aug. 14, 2023, was a tragic day for the world when we lost Zyquan Mitchell, more commonly known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Kody</a>, Famous Kody, or Mr. Blicky. The <a href=#>TikToker</a> was known for sharing videos of dancing and lip-syncing in different locations, not just of himself, but with his sisters and family members.</p><p>Lil Kody was wholesome, kind, and silly. And he was clearly loved by his fans, friends, and family. At just 21 years old, he was a father, brother, and beloved TikToker whose life was taken too soon in a tragic car accident. But what exactly happened to him?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Lil Kody? His cause of death was due to complications from a car accident.</h2><p>Car accidents aren’t always fatal, but sadly, the one Lil Kody got in was. While no one in the public knows exactly what happened to Lil Kody, we do know that he got in a car accident at some point between July 11 and 13. His last TikTok post was on July 11, and on the 13th, his sister, Zy’Kevia, posted a video with her thoughts and prayers for her brother’s recovery.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@_xykevia href=#>@_xykevia</a><p>My other half literally like day & night.

He’s still on the ventilator. He was in a car accident a couple of days ago. He is fighting but he is stable. We’re asking for prayers from everyone. Positive vibes only, guys.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sadly, however, Lil Kody was unable to pull through. Various sources have reported that his lungs didn't recover after about a month on the ventilator, ending Lil Kody’s life too soon. It’s unclear as to exactly what happened in the car accident — if any substances were involved or if anything was intentional — but it seems from reports that it was just an unfortunate and tragic accident.</p><p>Lil Kody’s sister is at the forefront of sharing the sad news. Throughout the month between his accident and death, she shared pictures and videos paying homage to her brother.</p><p>On Aug. 14, however, she wrote, “Life will never be the same. Your smile was always priceless, could brighten up the whole room. Zyquan how could you leave me, we was [sic] just getting started. Lord, I truly don’t understand. My baby brother (big brother) as you will say. Zyquan I’m going to miss you. Lord why.”</p><p>Zy’Kevia isn’t the only one mourning Lil Kody’s untimely death. He leaves behind a newborn daughter, Kahlani Dior Mitchell, born in January 2023, just eight months before her father’s passing. Several social media users also offered their condolences. Billie Feranté commented, “RIP Kody so genuine made an impact on TikTok as well. God, I pray for your families [sic] strength.”</p><p>Our condolences go out to all of Lil Kody’s friends, family, and fans mourning his loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSloZxiuLCw2GaroqOkpLg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
