According to the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, Loren wore a strapless princess-style gown while her groom donned a black tux and bowtie. Loren was reportedly driven to the ceremony in an "old-fashioned car," and her bridal party arrived at the wedding in an "old fashioned trolley."</p><p>Among the guests in attendance at Leinart and Loren's wedding were 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey and his wife, Vanessa Lachey. During the reception, Nick sang Stevie Wonder's "Superstition" alongside Loren's mother, as captured by a fellow guest and <a href=#>shared on Instagram</a>.</p><p>Leinart previously proposed to Loren in July 2016. Loren, who's made a name for herself with roles in The Mentalist, Make It or Break It, and 17 Again, <a href=#>took to Instagram</a> at the time to announce their engagement. Sharing a photo of herself with her then-fiancée — with her shiny new engagement ring on display — Loren wrote, "Woke up this morning (with a headache) thinking last night was a dream but my left hand told me it was real...yep, I get to spend the rest of my life with my best friend."</p><p>This is the first marriage for both Leinart and Loren, though they've been in serious relationships in the past. As Us Weekly noted, Leinart is a father to an 11-year-old son named Cole, whom he shares with ex Brynn Cameron — the same woman who shares two children with NBA star Blake Griffin. He also previously dated <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a> star Kristin Cavallari, socialite <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, and former Disney Channel darling Aly Michalka.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampkZ4Jze8WoqaadomK7p7iMrKuaql2irrXAjKWcoqaRp8FuucCrqaKdo2K6prrTmqOiq6Soequ70qKcZqSfp7Kvew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
