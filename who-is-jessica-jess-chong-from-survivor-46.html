She dove into her out-of-the-ordinary career path in her official biography for the beloved competition series:</p><p>“When I was 24, I quit two entry-level jobs in one year because I was hungry to learn (and earn) more. I started my own freelance web design business. By the time I was 29, one of my freelance gigs had turned into an incredible full-time job… I’m proud that after I transitioned my career into software engineering, I worked to help others make the transition too! I love mentoring people who are new to software engineering, especially when they’ve transitioned later in life.”</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>When the 37-year-old is not busy with her software engineering business, Jess enjoys sewing her own clothes — even hand-crafting ever single outfit she wears on Survivor 46 — biking around San Francisco with her husband, binge watching 80% of a television show before panicking about where the time has gone, and beyond.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Describing herself as silly, animated, compassionate, and persistent — and her friends describing her as empathetic, tenacious, smart, and a social butterfly — will Jessica “Jess” Chong have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast her fellow castaways?
