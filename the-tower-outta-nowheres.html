Intrigued, Geralt decided to investigate. Name: Fisherman<h2>Walkthrough</h2><p>Following contains quest spoilers. You’ve been warned</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Talk to the villagers.</h3>If you visit the village of Urialla Harbor on the southern shores of An Skellig, you’ll run into a group of warriors and fishermen talking in the center of the village. Approach them and one of the fishermen will signal you to approach and will tell you about a knoll outside the village.<p>Apparently, one day a tower appeared over it and started sending down the rain that has been pouring down on the settlement ever since. Agree to investigate the tower.</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Enter the tower.</h3><p>Head roughly northwest from the village. Follow the path while looking out for ekhidna until you reach some stone steps and wooden entry into the tower. Enter it, go down the stairs and into a portal.</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Defeat the golem.</h3><p>The main chamber you end up in has a golem. It is guarding three archways protected by magic barriers. Kill the golem then head to the magician stuck behind the southwestern barrier. He’ll tell you that the tower has defenses against intruders and that you must find a treatise hidden in the tower in order to deactivate them. You can ask more about the mage(Sigo is his name), if you want.</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Find the key to the library.</h3>Exit the main chamber through the tunnel heading northeast. Swim left when you reach the tunnel junction, then climb out of the water into a cavern that has old ruins protruding from the ground. The tower will then inform you that beast countermeasures are on. You’ll now have to face the monsters in the following order:<li>two ghouls and two alghouls</li><li>one gargoyle</li><li>a werewolf</li><li>a cow – don’t kill it</li>Once you’ve killed all the monsters, head into the small laboratory in the northeastern part of the cavern. Loot the box on the table and take the Key to Library.<h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Enter the library.</h3>Go back to the water-filled tunnel and take the other side tunnel at the junction. Head east and dive into the water, then resurface quickly and climb up the steps to the library.<p>Use your Witcher Senses to look for the book you’re here for. You’ll find it to the left of an old bookcase that has a corpse slumped against it. Take the Gottfried’s Omin-opening Grimoire. The tower will now try to kill you by unleashing some poison, so run back the way you came and head to the chamber with the magic barriers.</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Break the tower’s defenses with the mage’s help.</h3>Give to the book to the trapped mage; he will then free himself from the barrier. He’ll then warn you that you haven’t gone through the hardest part yet. You can now meditate and prepare, then head into the central chamber and deactivate the defenses.<p>Follow Sigo; he will deactivate the barrier to the northwest, rush to a pulpit at the center, and open a book to begin the incantations. The tower will then summon an earth elemental which you’ll have to defeat. Consult your bestiary.</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Talk to the mage.</h3><p>The mage will then talk to you. Tell him to move the tower away from the village and he’ll comply. The tower will disappear, leaving you to stand in midair. A moment later you’ll find yourself falling into the water.</p><h3 class=witcher_quest_objective>Talk to the villagers.</h3><p>Swim back to the villagers and tell them that you’ve got rid of the tower. They’ll rejoice at the news and give you something for your trouble. The quest has come to an end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jrCgrZuYmr9uf46tn55lpKTEpr6MqKytrJFiu7DDx56pnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
