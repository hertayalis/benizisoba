Khan claimed that he had evidence that certain accounts were sharing negative sentiment about the promotion and that it was being signal boosted by bots. Strowman then called Khan out once again.</p><p>Braun claimed that Tony Khan pays dirt sheet writers and claims that his wrestlers are free to work where they want. That is not the case, he noted. Strowman criticized Khan for blackballing AEW talents from appearing in the Control Your Narrative promotion.</p><p>“This is the same guy that pays the dirt sheets and says his wrestlers are free to do whatever but black balled them from CYN shows. Why??? Cause we’re a f*cking threat.”</p><p>Strowman, who now wrestles under his real name, has been critical of the major national promotions since joining CYN. Fans have blasted the organization for its ridiculous set of rules. There is also no evidence that Tony Khan pays wrestling sites to cover his company.</p><p>Braun continued to attack AEW when he told a fan that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watching Dynamite was ‘punishment.’</a> Strowman doesn’t seem likely to have a future with AEW. The Titan is completely fine with that.</p><p>Control Your Narrative has been harshly criticized by fans for being directionless. EC3 and his wrestlers have been staunch defenders of CYN. The offensive by Braun Strowman and his partners in CYN doesn’t show any signs of stopping.</p><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
